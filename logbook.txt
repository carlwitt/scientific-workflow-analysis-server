# Visualization server

## Task Models

Scatterplot matrices and parallel coordinates to find relationships between input features (file size, ancestors)
and output features (memory consumption, disk write, run time).

## Queue Heterogeneity

It would be interesting to also visualize the number of ready tasks per type over time 
to get an impression of the freedom the scheduler has during wf execution.

## Time Share

The time share visualization (percentage of cumulative compute time consumed by tasks of a type)
might not be very informative.
	1) scientists probably know what tasks are expensive
	2) the largest share of cumulative compute time must not indicate bottlenecks,
		lowest degree of parallelism might be more interesting. Could we compute that like
		for each task, compute on average the DOP (segment by start/stop, take ratios)
		sort by descending average DOP, nice point and highlight opportunity
		=> bottleneck/sequentiality visualization

## Compressed invocation graph

Waiting for a message that contains the workflow structure. Add multiplicities to the edges to 
visualize invocations and bottlenecks (bottleneck finding is probably more difficult, but this could be a start).

## Session selection

+ When loading the page, the newest session is auto-selected
+ "AJAX" reload the plot div on selection: Update callback for the dropdown widget (calls select_session) works fine.

## Currently active tasks

> Make plot full width
	gridplot([[p], [p2]], toolbar_location="left", plot_width=1500)
	manipulating the plot on the client side doesn't work, because it's a canvas object (changing its width will result in distorted scaling, e.g., fonts stretched)
> Retrieve deltas from the database?
	Store last polled in visualization server state

+ Make a custom patches renderer that stacks.
+ Add a manual legend box to the chart
	either manually update the legend: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/35935954/add-additional-curve-to-bokeh-chart
	more, less related:
		http://stackoverflow.com/questions/31419388/bokeh-how-to-add-legend-to-figure-created-by-multi-line-method
		http://stackoverflow.com/questions/25295853/how-to-show-legend-items-of-patches-in-bokeh
	or build a custom legend box (Div element) and add it in the plot row.
	> Since we might have many different task types
		hover on the legend would be nice (since color coding will be flawed for too many task types)
	> Move the legend
		According to [http://bokeh.pydata.org/en/latest/docs/user_guide/styling.html#location], this should suffice (but it doesn't)
		I guess it's the same problem as before: Gridplot overrides the settings of its components
			But removing the encapsulating gridplot element and adding the figure directly makes the problem worse. Now, none of the settings (toolbar position, legend position) take effect!
		p = figure([...])
		p.legend.location = "top_left"

+ Add axis labels to x axis to clarify the meaning of the tick labels (16h is not clear to refer to the date of the session, four o'clock)
 	Add the date of the session to the title of the chart. Add a title to the chart explaining its contents.
+ Make the y axis have integer ticks only.

>+ Can't add more than one column at a time:
	Using multipatch (to avoid having to add glyphs to the plot) and a complete exchange of the source.data dictionary (which is best practice anyway) does the trick.
	However, an off-the-shelve area graph doesn't seem to be possible this way, because it doesn't accept a ColumnDataSource
	 Area(source.data, ...) => TypeError: Input of table-like dict must be column-oriented. (because the dict has additional attributes, as I found out in debugging)
	 Area(source=source, ...) => TypeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute '__getitem__' in File "/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/bokeh/charts/properties.py", line 172, in set_data
    	self.selection = data[self.name]
 	causes the renderer to get stuck. recursive loop until error?
 		This seems to be caused by calling p.line twice??
	can't access it: 2016-08-08 13:17:25,255 Error thrown from periodic callback: KeyError('diffit5',)

+ Make the server stop once the connection is closed.
	This is handled automatically, but only after a minute. See my answer here:
		http://stackoverflow.com/questions/29077376/bokeh-session-and-document-polling/38895094#38895094
	We need to make the pull client side, which is easy in principle, because we're listening to the widgets all the time anyway.
	So a refresh button works fine, but I'd like to have it automatically.
	The obvious workaround seems to be a hidden refresh button that is automatically pressed once in a while, but doing this in javascript is difficult becaue of the minified bokehjs doesn't really allow to interfere.
	 So there should be more elegant ways like adding a callback to an element that periodically calls a function that is bound to a pyhton function?

	 	var intervalID = setInterval(function(){alert("Interval reached");}, 5000);
	 	clearInterval(intervalID);

+ Time axis: The generation_time attribute of a pymongo ObjectId object gives a python datetime object is correctly handled by bokeh datetime axes
	event['time'].generation_time
	Datetime axis example [http://bokeh.pydata.org/en/latest/docs/user_guide/quickstart.html#datetime-axes]\

+ new columns can be added via
 	source.add([0] * len(source.data["time"]), "merge")
	The docs say: "There is an implicit assumption that all the columns in a a given ColumnDataSource have the same length."
	Returning nothing is o.k.
	another common technique (see movies example) is to exchange the entire data dictionary of a column data source

+ Add data points: new_data is a dict that provides a list for each time series containing the new data points.

+ Render simple time series
	Using the ColumnDataSet, one can specify the data as column name in ggplot style:
	p.line(x='time', y='average', alpha=0.2, line_width=3, color='color', source=source)

+ Add a legend:	just add a legend label to the renderer
	p.line(x='time', y='merge', legend='to appear in legend', [...])

+ Remove the limit on history:
	p.x_range.follow_interval = None
	source.stream(new_data, None) # the second parameter of stream is rollover, which determines the cyclic buffer size.

+ Find a good color scheme (brewer? continuous?)
	Bokeh Palletes should suffic
	e.g.: Paired [http://bokeh.pydata.org/en/latest/docs/reference/palettes.html]

## General information

+ Find a label display element for showing (streaming, also?) the number of messages. Use custom html+css filled Div widget
